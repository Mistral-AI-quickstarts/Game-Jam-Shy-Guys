# Shyguy's Wingman

**Shyguy's Wingman** was built during the **Mistral AI Game Jam** with the theme: *"You donâ€™t control the character."* In this game, you influence \"Shy Guy\" at a homecoming party by whispering advice or pushing him into action, helping him gain the courage to talk to the girl he likes.
